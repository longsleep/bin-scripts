#
# Simple script to turn on/off the keyboard backlight of a Cromebook with
# the leds_chromeos_keyboard Kernel driver. See my patches to get this driver
# into a custom Kernel as it is not included by default.
# See https://github.com/longsleep/linux_patches/tree/pixel
#
# The backlight can only be changed as root, thus sudo is used in this script.
# To make this work, add the following like to your sudoes file
# ALL ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /sys/class/leds/chromeos\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness
#
# Thats it.
#
